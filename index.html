    <h1>this is my first day</h1>
 <p> A first day story typically recounts the experience of starting something new, often a school or a job.<br>
  It frequently involves feelings of nervousness, excitement, and the process of adapting to a new environment and meeting new people.<br>
  These stories often highlight the challenges of navigating unfamiliar situations and the eventual joy of 
  making new friends  finding one's place. </p>
